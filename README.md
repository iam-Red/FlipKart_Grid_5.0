# Blockchain-based: Loyalty and Rewards Program using Fungible Tokens
The aim of the project is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly blockchain-based platform that utilizes fungible tokens to revolutionize the way users engage with purchasing items and coupons, while also enabling seamless token transfers among themselves.
